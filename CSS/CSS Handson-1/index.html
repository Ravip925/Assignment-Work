    <p id="p1">What is CSS?</p>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li><span id="s1">CSS is not neccesary</span>. <mark><span id="s2">CSS saves a lot of work</span></mark>. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <li><span id="s3">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</span>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p id="p1">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - By using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Internal - By using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - By using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <mark><span id="s4">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span></mark> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing  CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors used to target a special elements on a web page. Once an elements has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most used are Class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
